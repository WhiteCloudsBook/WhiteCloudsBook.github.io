            The year is <span class="hls">2843</span>. More than five centuries after a fraction of humanity left a
            dying Earth behind. Now, humans dwell aboard giant space stations called <span class="hl">THE CLOUDS</span>.
            <br />
            <br />
            Up until a few days ago, life was good for <span class="hl">WENDALL SYING</span>. He was top of his class in
            pilot-school, had good
            friends and a loving and supportive mother. His dream was to become an exploration pilot like his father
            was. That's
            until his mother was found dead.
            <br />
            <br />
            Without any time to grieve, Wendall finds himself being <span class="italic">hunted</span>. His only link to
            understanding what’s going on is a
            recording
            left by his mom. In it she reveals that she was part of a vigilance group with the sole purpose of
            preventing a <span class="italic">sentient
                AI</span> from rising again. When last encountered, this entity had killed tens of thousands.
            <br />
            <br />
            Whoever is hunting Wendall is trying to resurrect the AI. It's not what Wendall can do or what he knows but
            <span class="italic">what he is</span>.
            His very DNA is fused with the AI's code and they'll do anything to get their hands on him. Without him they
            cannot
            bring back the entity fully and fulfill their plan to instate it as ruler over humans.
             <br />
            <br />
            When his pursuers kill a friend sent to help him reach safety, Wendall is left completely alone. He has to
            decide
            whether to run or join the fight. If he runs, his pursuers will no doubt hurt more of his friends. If he
            stays to fight
            and gets caught the AI would be unstoppable. According to the Vigilance, setting it loose on the Clouds
            could only mean
            one thing – <span class="hls">Annihilation</span>.
            <br />
            <br />
            Either way, Wendall has no choice but to confront what he cannot outrun - The part of the AI entity that's
            <span class="italic">inside him</span>.
