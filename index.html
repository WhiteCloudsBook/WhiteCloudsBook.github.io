        In the 24<sup>th</sup> century humans learned that Earth would soon no longer be able to sustain life. A fraction of humanity was spared and set course through the vastness of the galaxy in massive spaceships to settle an earth-like planet. After a journey fraught with danger they reached their destination only to discover their new home was not habitable after all. Without the resources to venture out to space again they decided to stay and build a station that will sustain them.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Now, almost 500 years later, humanity is thriving on enormous space stations, fondly called The Clouds, orbiting the hostile planet. Thoughts of finding a terrestrial home to inhabit long abandoned. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Wendall Sying, a stellar young piloting cadet, finds his life suddenly shattered when his mother is discovered dead at their home. Orphaned, with no time to grieve he must go on the run from powerful forces he didn’t even know exist. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        With the assistance of companions he meets along the way, Dall will try to survive his own perilous journey he was thrust into. Yet little does he know just how central he is in a struggle, that began centuries ago, which the results of will determine the fate of the entire human race.
