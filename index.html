            The year is <span class="hls">2843</span>. More than five centuries after a fraction of humanity left a
            dying Earth behind. Now, humans dwell aboard giant space stations called <span class="hl">THE CLOUDS</span>.
            <br />
            <br />
            What starts as a normal day for <span class="hl">WENDALL SYING</span> becomes a nightmare when he is told
            his mom was found dead at home. With
            no time to grieve, Wendall must leave everything behind because that's what his mom instructs him to do in a
            recording
            she left. In it she reveals that she was part of a vigilance group with the sole purpose of preventing a
            <span class="hls" sentient AI></span>
            from rising again. When last encountered, this entity had killed tens of thousands.
            <br />
            <br />
            Whoever is hunting him is trying to resurrect the AI and they need Wendall not for what he can do or what he
            knows but
            <span class="italic">what he is</span>. His very DNA is fused with the AI's code which they must have in
            order to bring back the entity fully - To
            fulfill their plan to instate it as ruler over humanity.
            <br />
            <br />
            When his pursuers kill a friend sent to help him reach safety, Wendall is left completely alone. He has to
            decide
            whether to run or join the fight. If he runs, his pursuers will no doubt hurt more of his friends. If he
            stays to fight
            and gets caught the AI would be <span class="italic">unstoppable</span>. According to the Vigilance, setting
            it loose on the Clouds could only mean
            one thing – <span class="hl">Annihilation</span>.
            <br />
            <br />
            Either way, Wendall has no choice but to confront what he cannot outrun - The part of the AI entity that's
            <span class="italic">inside him</span>.
